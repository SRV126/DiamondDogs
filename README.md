# Location Tracker
Raj Singh
November, 2014

## Overview

This is a tutorial on how to build a mobile app in HTML5 and Javascript that records a deviceâ€™s location and saves the location data to IBM's Cloudant JSON database service. A simple mapping client using Leaflet is also described. 

UPDATE June, 2016:  We have several sample apps covering location tracking with Cloudant. Use the one that fits your coding needs best. There's a bare-bones [couchapp](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/location-tracker-couchapp/), [one for Angular (version 1)/NodeJS developers](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/location-tracker-nodejs), and the ]latest using Swift/iOS on the client-side](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/location-tracker-client-swift) with a [NodeJS back-end](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/location-tracker-server-nodejs/).
## Code

The code for this tutorial is organized into a CouchApp (as described in the [tutorial](./tutorial)), so all the web files are in the [_attachments](./_attachments) directory.

## Tutorial

An extensive tutorial describing the app may be found in the [tutorial](./tutorial) directory.
